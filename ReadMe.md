For my Q3 project at Galvanize I created an Instagram clone by following a series of tutorial videos on YouTube.
It took me about a week to learn how to use Xcode and finish building the app. I learned about how to set up storyboards,
connect view controllers, and connect Firebase to my project. With Firebase I was able to create users, and posts.
Learning Swift was interesting from my normal Javascript development because it was more strict about what had to be denoted in the program.
