# Instagram-Clone
While I was at Galvanize I wanted to work on making an iphone app using Swift. I am quite a fan of Instagram, so I decided it would be fun to work on building a simple Instagram app.

This app has most of the basic features of its more popular counterpart, including account creation, posting images, liking other peopleâ€™s pictures, and following and unfollowing other users.

# Challenges
I was brand new to using Swift, and this was the first app I had built using the language. I found it to be different than Javascript because of the need to declare variable data types when creating them. It was also a challenge learning all of the new syntax. 

I was also new to Xcode, so I had to start watching videos on how to setup my work environment. I found a series of tutorials online that helped guide me on building this Instagram clone, so took my time carefully watching them, and following their lead. 

This was the first time I used Firebase to setup a database. It took some time to figure out how to access my user data tables, and interact with the data that I had stored.

# How it works!

## A user is first taken to the login screen where they can login, or create a new account.

## After they log in they will see a list of active users, and can choose which ones they want to follow.

## The user can then navigate to the feed view, which will display the posts from each user that they followed

## The user may also want to create a post. By selecting the "+" button on the feed view, they can select an image from their phone, and upload it!
