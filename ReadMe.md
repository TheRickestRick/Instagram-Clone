# Instagram-Clone
While I was at Galvanize I wanted to work on making an iphone app using Swift. I am quite a fan of Instagram, so I decided it would be fun to work on building a simple Instagram app.

This app has most of the basic features of its more popular counterpart, including account creation, posting images, liking other peopleâ€™s pictures, and following and unfollowing other users.

# Challenges
I am still very new to using Swift, and this was the first app I had built using the language. I found it to be different than Javascript because of the need to declare variable data types when creating them. 

I was also new to Xcode, so I had to start watching videos on how to setup my work environment. I found a series of tutorials online that helped guide me on building this Instagram clone, so took my time carefully watching them, and following their lead.
